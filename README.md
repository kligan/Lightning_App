# virtual Keyboard

## com.domain.app.virtualKeyboard

This is a lightningJs app which renders a virtual keyboard using webrenderer.

Key features of the keyboard
1. A view that contains a text field and a list which contains alphanumeric characters,
2. Pressing the arrow keys will navigate through the list of characters,
3. Pressing the ‘select’ key will append the focused character to the text field,
4. Pressing the ‘delete’ key will remove the last character from the text field,

### Getting started

> Before you follow the steps below, make sure you have the
[Lightning-CLI](https://rdkcentral.github.io/Lightning-CLI/#/) installed _globally_ only your system

```
npm install -g @lightningjs/cli
```

#### Running the App

1. Install the NPM dependencies by running `npm install`

2. Build the App using the _Lightning-CLI_ by running `lng build` inside the root of your project

3. Fire up a local webserver and open the App in a browser by running `lng serve` inside the root of your project

#### Developing the App

During development you can use the **watcher** functionality of the _Lightning-CLI_.

- use `lng watch` to automatically _rebuild_ your App whenever you make a change in the `src` or  `static` folder
- use `lng dev` to start the watcher and run a local webserver / open the App in a browser _at the same time_
